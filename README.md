# Vaccinator
I made Vaccinator during the spring of 2021 for my Operating Systems class.

The purpose of this program is to help people register for their Covid-19 vaccination. There is also a feature that simulates the vaccination with processes, signals, and pipes.

# Skills Demonstrated

* Implemented a feature that simulates the vaccination with processes, signals, and pipes.
